# Documentation Standards — v1

Documentation contract for this project. Pairs with
[coding](coding.md), [naming](naming.md), [testing](testing.md),
[commits](commits.md); see the [index](README.md). Governs
`Kind: doc` / `doc-fix` bullets. What to **name** a doc file (specs,
ADRs, journals, design docs) is in [naming.md](naming.md); ROADMAP.md
and CHANGELOG.md format details live in a separate sub-spec at
[`roadmap-format.md`](roadmap-format.md).


## 1. Principles

### 1.1 Six-month test

A reader six months from now should be able to use the doc
without the author present. If the doc says "see the recent
change", that won't be true in six months — replace with a
durable reference (`src/foo.py` + section name).

### 1.2 Show, don't claim

Examples beat prose. A README that *shows* the command + expected
output beats one that *describes* what the command does. Code
blocks should be runnable as-is.

### 1.3 Date format — ISO 8601

`YYYY-MM-DD`. No `Apr 28 2026`, no `28/04/2026`, no relative dates
(`yesterday`, `last week`) in committed docs. Relative dates rot.

### 1.4 Don't reference what isn't shipped

Doc lands when the feature lands. Forward-references to unshipped
features go in `ROADMAP.md`, not `README.md` or contract docs.

### 1.5 One source of truth per fact

Don't repeat the install steps in README + INSTALL + CONTRIBUTING
+ SETUP. Pick the canonical home; cross-link from the others.


## 2. Project-level files

### 2.1 README.md

Required sections, in order:

1. **Masthead** — project name, one-line description, and badges
   *as available* (e.g. license; build once CI exists). The version
   is not a required badge — its canonical home is the
   Current-version line (item 2), per § 1.5.
2. **Current version** — single line: `Current version: X.Y.Z`
   with links to CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, and any companion docs.
3. **Features** — bulleted list of headline capabilities.
4. **Install** — one-line install for each supported platform.
5. **Quickstart** — minimal command sequence to use the project.
6. **Plugin / extension** (if applicable) — link to the plugin
   author contract.
7. **Documentation** — links to `docs/`, including the four
   standards docs.
8. **License** — single line + link.

Avoid: a TOC for a short README; "About" / "Why" sections without
content; broken screenshot links.

### 2.2 CLAUDE.md

For projects worked on with Claude Code: the project-specific
instructions Claude should follow. Lives at the repo root.
Typical contents:

- Module map (one line per major subsystem).
- Build instructions.
- Testing instructions.
- Conventions specific to this codebase.
- Key design decisions that aren't obvious from reading the code.

Keep it terse — the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` covers
machine-wide rules; this file only covers project-specific ones.

### 2.3 LICENSE / COPYING / NOTICE

Standard files at the repo root. Use the SPDX-tagged canonical
license text — don't paraphrase.

### 2.4 SECURITY.md

For projects that accept external bug reports: disclosure policy,
contact email, GPG key (if used), supported-version table.

### 2.5 CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Contributor Covenant 2.1 verbatim is the default. Don't write
your own unless the project has a specific reason.

### 2.6 CONTRIBUTING.md (optional)

For projects accepting external contributors: build steps, test
expectations, how to file issues, how to propose features. Should
link to all four standards docs in this folder.


## 3. ROADMAP.md and CHANGELOG.md formats

The detailed format specs for both files — used by the Ants
Terminal Roadmap dialog and any tooling that consumes them
deterministically — live in
[`roadmap-format.md`](roadmap-format.md) (split out for
token efficiency; only relevant when authoring those files).

The high-level rules:

- `ROADMAP.md` is the single place to track unshipped work;
  shipped work moves to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `ROADMAP.md` uses status emojis (✅🚧📋💭), theme emojis,
  and stable per-bullet IDs (`<project>-NNNN` from
  `.roadmap-counter`) plus phase IDs (`P##`, `FP##`, `DS##`,
  `DOC##`, `R##`).
- `CHANGELOG.md` follows
  [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) with
  an `[Unreleased]` block at the top.

For details — including the format-version comment, theme
emoji set, current-work signalling rules, bullet contract, and
release flow — read [`roadmap-format.md`](roadmap-format.md).

## 4. API / contract docs

For any project that exposes an API, a plugin contract, or a
machine-readable surface (`PLUGINS.md`, `API.md`,
`openapi.yaml`):

- **Document every public symbol.** If a function is exported,
  it's part of the contract.
- **Include the version it was added in.** Helps consumers know
  what they can rely on. Example: `Added in 0.6.5`.
- **Show input + output examples.** Type signatures alone aren't
  enough.
- **Mark deprecation explicitly.** `Deprecated since X.Y.Z; use
  Foo instead.`
- **Provide a migration path** for any deprecated / removed
  surface.


## 5. In-code documentation

Defer to [coding § 3](coding.md). Default is no comments; only
WHY non-obvious things need them. Don't write multi-paragraph
docstrings.


## 6. Screenshots

This section owns **screenshot** filenames specifically; general file &
directory naming (including other image / icon assets) is in
[naming.md](naming.md).

- **Path** — `docs/screenshots/` or `assets/screenshots/`.
- **Filename** — `<feature>-<state>.png`
  (`terminal-tabs-active.png`, not `Screenshot 2026-04-28.png`).
- **Format** — PNG for UI, JPG for photographic content.
- **Caption** every screenshot in the surrounding prose.
- **Replace, don't accumulate.** When the feature changes, swap
  the screenshot. Don't pile up `_old` / `_v2` versions.


## 7. Markdown style

- ATX headings (`# `, `## `, `### `) — never setext (`====`).
- One blank line before/after headings.
- Tables for structured data, fenced code blocks for code.
- Line wrap at ~70–80 columns for readability in `git diff`.
  Don't force-wrap inside code blocks or tables.
- Links: `[text](url)` not `<url>`, unless the URL itself is
  meant as the visible text.
- Lists: `- ` for bullets, `1. ` for numbered. Don't mix `*` and
  `-` in one file.
- Inline code: backticks for filenames, function names, CLI
  flags.


## 8. Doc reviews

Schedule periodic doc reviews independent from code reviews —
the two drift independently. A doc review surfaces:

- Stale CLI flag references.
- Screenshots showing the previous version's UI.
- "Recent change" / "yesterday" relative dates.
- Sections that document a feature that was removed.
- Cross-references to renamed files / functions.
- ROADMAP / CHANGELOG bullets whose claims don't match the
  shipped code.

Findings from a doc review fold into the ROADMAP under
`### 📚 Documentation review fold-in (YYYY-MM-DD)` per [`roadmap-format.md` § 3.8](roadmap-format.md).


## 9. Anti-patterns

- ❌ Lorem ipsum or placeholder text in committed docs.
- ❌ Screenshots that show the previous version's UI.
- ❌ "We" / "I" — use second person ("the user", "you").
- ❌ Markdown that doesn't render correctly on GitHub (test it).
- ❌ Documentation for a feature that hasn't shipped (goes in
  ROADMAP.md instead).
- ❌ Stale CLI flag references — sweep every doc when a flag
  changes.
- ❌ Relative dates in committed docs (`recently`, `last week`).
- ❌ A README so long a new contributor bounces off the page.
