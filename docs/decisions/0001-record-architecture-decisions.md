# ADR-0001: Record architecture decisions

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-06-30
- **Deciders:** Project lead
- **Related:** [docs/decisions/README.md](README.md)

## Context

Architectural decisions accrete invisibly. Three months after
choosing Qt 6 over GTK, no one remembers why; six months after
adopting `QFileSystemWatcher` for config reload, the gotchas
that drove the choice are gone. New contributors propose
"obviously better" alternatives that were already considered
and rejected.

Without a record, the project repeats the discovery cycle every
time the choice resurfaces — wasting time and risking a worse
outcome (the old context that informed the original decision is
no longer in anyone's head).

## Decision

Capture significant architectural decisions as ADRs in
`docs/decisions/`, following Michael Nygard's lightweight
format (Cognitect, 2011). One markdown file per decision,
numbered sequentially (`0001-`, `0002-`, …), never edited after
acceptance.

The format for each ADR:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: <short title>

- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNNN
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Deciders:** <names / roles>
- **Related:** <links to other ADRs, ROADMAP items, etc.>

## Context

What forces are at play, what problem are we solving, what
alternatives were considered.

## Decision

The chosen approach, stated clearly. One sentence if possible.

## Consequences

What changes — positive, negative, neutral. Be honest about the
trade-offs the decision accepts.
```

A design ADR additionally carries a `## Cold-eyes loop log` section
recording its `/cold-eyes` convergence (global rule §14). That log is
filled as part of reaching **Accepted** — reconciling with
"never edited after acceptance", populating it is the one edit the rule
permits once the `Status:` line reads Accepted.

Files are checked in to `docs/decisions/`. The folder's
[README.md](README.md) explains the lifecycle and when to write
one.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- New contributors can read the rationale for any major
  structural choice without asking the author.
- Decisions that turn out to be wrong can be superseded
  cleanly with a new ADR; the trail of reasoning is preserved.
- ADRs serve as a sanity check during design — if writing the
  ADR feels hard, the decision probably needs more thought.

**Negative:**

- Some discipline cost — writing an ADR for a "minor" decision
  that turns out to be load-bearing later is easy to skip.
- A few extra markdown files in the repo. Counted against the
  "documentation drift" risk in the doc-review process (see
  [documentation § 8](../standards/documentation.md)).

**Neutral:**

- ADRs are not a substitute for code comments at the call-site
  — they live at a higher level of abstraction. The two layers
  complement each other (ADR for "why we chose X over Y", code
  comment for "this specific line works around constraint Z").
